# Halo Branch from SkyPy

This folder contains a duplicated version of the `halo` & `power_spectrum` module from the SkyPy package. This module is currently in a different branch to the main SkyPy branch and has not been merged into the main repository. The duplication is a temporary measure to ensure functionality while the original module is under development.

## Reason for the Duplicate

Some of the tests in our project were failing due to the absence of the `halo` & `power_spectrum` module in the main SkyPy package. As a short-term solution, we decided to copy the required functions from the SkyPy's separate branch with proper attribution.


## Credits and Acknowledgment

The code within this folder is based on the work developed by the SkyPy team and is directly sourced from the SkyPy repository, specifically from a separate branch which contains the `halo` (along with `power_spectrum`) module. We deeply appreciate the effort of the SkyPy developers in creating and maintaining this module.

**Original Source**: [SkyPy GitHub Repository (module halos)](https://github.com/skypyproject/skypy/tree/module/halos)

This duplication is only meant for temporary usage and is not an attempt to claim originality or ownership of the module. We remain grateful to the SkyPy developers for their contributions to the community and their understanding in this matter.
