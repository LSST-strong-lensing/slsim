=========================================
Onboarding to LSST Strong lensing project
=========================================

This GitHub project originates from an inter-collaboration agreement between
the two LSST Science collaborations:

- `Strong Lensing Science Collaboration (SLSC) <https://sites.google.com/view/lsst-stronglensing?pli=1>`_
- `Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) <https://lsstdesc.org>`_

You need to sign up for either one or both Science Collaboration to have access to LSST resources, communications and the Slack channel.
We encourage you to sign up for both science collaborations.


We have setup a document outlining how the LSST strong lensing simulation infrastructure could look like
and what principles to follow to develop `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dlwi7vP0jIL_miOF8VRiWd_0sALR4tklZlIIPuBJz9U/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
We have also set up a software project template that you can use to submit your work package
`with this link <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCyo0D9XF48VNT7l8OvGBgxP3V4SLRlPxAJSrm2-ubg/edit>`_ (please copy the google docs file before editing).
