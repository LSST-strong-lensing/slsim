LSST strong lensing simulation pipeline.

This GitHub project originates from an intercollaboration agreement between
the two LSST Science collaborations:

- `Strong Lensing Science Collaboration (SLSC) <https://sites.google.com/view/lsst-stronglensing?pli=1>`_
- `Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) <https://lsstdesc.org>`_

This repository provides the simulation tools for the purpose of conducting strong gravitational lensing science with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
All the tools are open-source available. Check out below how you can contribute and become part of the LSST strong lensing science.
